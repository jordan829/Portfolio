                    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
                    <p> 
                        This is a prototype for an application providing music streaming and playlist creation. It was created to be an improvement upon existing apps 
                        such as Spotify or Apple Music. While working in a group of 3, I was personally responsible for conducting interviews, determining important user 
                        scenarios, task analysis, and interface design.

                    <h2>Interviews</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The process of creating this prototype began with our group conducting interviews of other students who regularly use music streaming apps. 
                        I personally conducted 4 interviews between friends and other UCSD students. This project was mainly focused on the user&#39;s experience while 
                        creating and managing their personal playlists, and our questions reflected this. We aimed to determine what tasks and scenarios are most 
                        regularly performed by users.  
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
                        
            <div style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; padding-top:2.5%; padding-bottom:2.5%; background-color: #f2f2f2;">
                <div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right:5%;">
                    <h2>User Scenarios</h2>
                    <p> 
                        After conducting the interviews, we then had our interviewees walk us through 3 different scenarios that reflected their responses during the 
                        interview. For example, one interviewee mentioned that he sometimes likes to search for artists similar to artists that he already knows of and
                        enjoys. After the interview, I had him walk me through the process of finding such information, taking screenshots of each action he performs. 
                        After all of the interviews were conducted, we tallied up all of our user scenarios and then performed full walkthroughs of the five most popular.

                    <h2>Task Analysis</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Once we determined which scenarios were the most common, we began our task analyses. These analyses consisted of 3 walkthroughs per scenario, each 
                        within a separate music app. These apps included Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and Soundcloud. We charted the number of actions performed to 
                        determine which apps cater to these tasks the best. We used the results from these analyses to help guide us during our own application design process.

                    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                    <p> 
                        After completing our research, we began the stages of prototyping our app. I was made personally responsible for designing the majority of the user 
                        interface. I used Balsamiq to create images for individual pages and menus. These included the home page, the playlists page, drop down menus, and 
                        individual artist/album pages. While creating these pages, I had to keep in mind how to improve our app and make it more user friendly. During this 
                        process, I had to make many hard decisions, the most notable of which are listed below.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; padding-top:2.5%; padding-bottom:2.5%; background-color: #f2f2f2;">
                <div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right:5%;">
                    <h3>What to use for the home page?</h3>
                    <p> 
                       I decided to give users direct access to playlists, library, and browse upon launching the app. These seemed to be the most popular sections across 
                        all music apps. Additionally, we concluded amongst our group that the information included on home pages for the other apps that we analyzed were 
                        not very useful for the average user.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right:5%;">
                    <h3>How to streamline the process of adding to playlists?</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I noticed from our conducted interviews that many users only had 1 playlist or a main playlist that they would continuously update with new songs. 
                        To appeal to these users, I decided to add a &quot;Main Playlist&quot; feature. User&#39;s can select which playlist they want to be their main playlist. When adding 
                        a song they are given the option to &quot;Add to Main Playlist&quot; instead of having to find this playlist in a separate list.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; padding-top:2.5%; padding-bottom:2.5%; background-color: #f2f2f2;">
                <div style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right:5%;">
                    <h3>How to organize user&#39;s music library?</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I realized that users prefer to have their music library displayed to them in different ways. Some users prefer to have their music sorted by artist, while 
                        others prefer to have just a list of all of their saved songs. To make this easier, I included a drop down menu on the &quot;My Music&quot; page that displays these 
                        different options. Ideally, the app would save whichever setting the user chose last so that they would not have to make the same decision each time they view their library.
